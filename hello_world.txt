 Hello My name is Projjwal. I am an aspiring Software developer.

Cheatsheet:-

This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. 
(You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) 
Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

Commands related to a remote repository:
  1. git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
  2. git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
Commands related to workflow:
  1. git add .
  2. git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
  1. git status
  2. git log
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).

How to:-
https://cbea.ms/git-commit/

//basics of git++

//git stash: we put it to backstage and it will show not commit to make after making 
changes
//git stash pop: take back to onstage
//git stash clear: clear backstage

//branch:

//git branch branch_name(create a branch)
//git checkout branch_name(change to that branch)
//git merge branch_name(merge that branch to origin)

//road to pull request:

//we need to fork a git repo -> we need to clone that to our local 
machine -> we need to create branch -> we need to push that branch to origin
of our forked -> *(then autometiaclly a pop up appered merge and pull request)

//thats how it done
//one branch can assosiated with only one pull request
//create different branch for diifferent features
//ONE BRANCH == ONE PULL request
